# üí∏ Crowd-Funding Web3 App - Vite, React & Thirdweb

## Overview
Crowd-Funding Web3 App is a decentralized platform for raising funds using blockchain technology. Built with **Vite**, **React**, and **Thirdweb**, it allows users to create campaigns and donate using cryptocurrency.  
Deployed on Vercel and Smart contract on Goerli testnet. 
This project highlights my ability to build Web3 frontends. (though smart contract is also written by me :} )


**[Live Demo](#)** - *Note: Add your live demo link here if available!*

## Features
- **Create Campaigns**: Users can launch crowdfunding campaigns with descriptions and goals.
- **Donate Crypto**: Seamless donations using Thirdweb‚Äôs Web3 integration.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Campaign progress updates in real-time.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Intuitive design for Web3 interactions.

## Tech Stack
- **Vite**: For fast frontend development.
- **React**: For building reusable UI components.
- **Thirdweb**: For Web3 integration (smart contracts, wallet connections).
- **CSS**: Custom styles for a clean look.

# Relevance to Amana

- This project aligns with Amana‚Äôs Web3 frontend needs:Built with React, part of Amana‚Äôs stack, and Vite (similar to Next.js for frontend).
- Focuses on Web3 user interactions (e.g., donations), like Amana‚Äôs gasless actions (e.g., ‚ÄúDeposit Gasless‚Äù).
- Shows my experience with DeFi-like apps, directly relevant to Amana‚Äôs yield aggregator.

## Contribution

I built this app from scratch, designing the UI and integrating Web3 functionality with Thirdweb. I focused on making the crowdfunding process seamless and intuitive for users.
